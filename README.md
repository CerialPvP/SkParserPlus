# SkParser+

Hello, and welcome to the SkParser+ repository! This is a Discord bot which allows you to input Skript code and then parse it.

## How does this bot work?

As mentioned above,
- You input Skript code
- The bot sends your code to a Skript parsing server
- Our parsing server returns the parsing results

## How can I invite it?

Soon, there will be an invite link available. I don't know when, but there will be one available.
